Project Worksheet – Project Two – First App - Backend
SEI-pineapple

Project Description:
This is the backend portion for an app that allows a user to input a movie quote and attach it to the movie that it came from. A fellow cohort mate helped me to come up with this idea, so I am very thankful to that person (not a member of this project group)
